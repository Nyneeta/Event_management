Online Event Management System

This is a web-based application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. It is designed to manage and simplify the organization of college events by student clubs and departments. The project runs locally using XAMPP and supports role-based access for both admins and students.

The system includes two main dashboards. The admin dashboard allows event creation, club management, and registration tracking. The student dashboard lets users view upcoming events and register for the ones they are interested in. All event and registration data is stored in a MySQL database for easy retrieval and analysis.

To run the project, place the folder in the htdocs directory of XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL, and import the provided SQL file into phpMyAdmin. Then open the project in your browser using http://localhost/project-folder-name. Students can register directly from the site, and admins can log in from the admin panel.
